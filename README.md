# RiskyRain2Mods
Online collection for my Risk of Rain 2 mods. Feel free to have a look at them.

## Item Tweaks
Changes some items to be more useful, and it's very configurable. Changes include:
- Repulsion Armor Plate now reduces incoming damage by 1% of the players's maximum health (doesn't apply to monsters).
- Mired Urn only attacks enemies.
- Titanic Knurl gives a 15% health bonus instead of flat 40.
- Paul's Goat Hoof's bonus per stack is reduced to 9% so it doesn't trump Energy Drink -- Energy Drink can optionally be buffed instead.
- More to come? Maybe?
